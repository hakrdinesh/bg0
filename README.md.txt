Srila Prabhupada Pranati

nama om visnu padaya krsna-prestaya bhu-tale
srimate bhaktivedanta-svamin iti namine

I offer my respectful obeisances unto His Divine Grace
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, who is very dear to
Lord Krsna, having taken shelter at His lotus feet.


namas te sarasvate deve gaura-vani-pracarine
nirvisesa-sunyavadi-pascatya-desa-tarine

Our respectful obeisances are unto you, O spiritual master,
servant of Sarasvati Gosvami. You are kindly preaching the
message of Lord Caitanyadeva and delivering the Western countries,
which are filled with impersonalism and voidism.
